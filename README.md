This is a **tic tac toe game with an AI** developped in java.

The game can be played between 2 players, or alone against an AI.
The AI uses the [alpha-beta pruning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to evaluate all the possibilities.
As it cannot be beaten, the player can choose different difficulty settings, which limit the depth of the of the search and add randomness.

The game looks like the following:
